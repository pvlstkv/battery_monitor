# Battery charge monitor
## _About project_
This is a useful thing for laptops. You know, it's very bad when you discharge your battery to 0% and charge to 100%. Much better when you keep battery level between 20% and 80% approximately. When you work you don't think about it. But this small project allows you to forget about this problem. This script notifies you about a low or high level battery charge. You just need plugin or unplug your battery charge adapter.
